# Advent of Code 2017

Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) edition by Jeroen Heijmans.

## Running

Open up `index.html` in a modern browser.

For maximum convenience I recommend using [livereload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livereload) by installing globally (`npm install --global livereload`) and then just serving the repository with `livereload .`. 
Then the `index.html` file will automatically reload if you tweak solutions.

## Lessons
